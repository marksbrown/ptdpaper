abstract = {We have explored methods for optimizing the timing resolution of an LSO-based detector module for a single-ring, "demonstration" time-of-flight PET camera. By maximizing the area that couples the scintillator to the PMT and minimizing the average path length that the scintillation photons travel, a single detector timing resolution of 218 ps fwhm is measured, which is considerably better than the \~{}385 ps fwhm obtained by commercial LSO or LYSO TOF detector modules. We explored different surface treatments (saw-cut, mechanically polished, and chemically etched) and reflector materials (Teflon tape, ESR, Lumirror, Melinex, white epoxy, and white paint), and found that for our geometry, a chemically etched surface had 5\% better timing resolution than the saw-cut or mechanically polished surfaces, and while there was little dependence on the timing resolution between the various reflectors, white paint and white epoxy were a few percent better. Adding co-dopants to LSO shortened the decay time from 40 ns to \~{}30 ns but maintained the same or higher total light output. This increased the initial photoelectron rate and so improved the timing resolution by 15\%. Using photomultiplier tubes with higher quantum efficiency (blue sensitivity index of 13.5 rather than 12) improved the timing resolution by an additional 5\%. By choosing the optimum surface treatment (chemically etched), reflector (white paint), LSO composition (co-doped), and PMT (13.5 blue sensitivity index), the coincidence timing resolution of our detector module was reduced from 309 ps to 220 ps fwhm.},

abstract = {Much research is being conducted on position-sensitive scintillation detectors for medical imaging, particularly for emission tomography. Monte Carlo simulations play an essential role in many of these research activities. As the scintillation process, the transport of scintillation photons through the crystal(s), and the conversion of these photons into electronic signals each have a major influence on the detector performance; all of these processes may need to be incorporated in the model to obtain accurate results. In this work the optical and scintillation models of the GEANT4 simulation toolkit are validated by comparing simulations and measurements on monolithic scintillator detectors for high-resolution positron emission tomography (PET). We have furthermore made the GEANT4 optical models available within the user-friendly GATE simulation platform (as of version 3.0). It is shown how the necessary optical input parameters can be determined with sufficient accuracy. The results show that the optical physics models of GATE/GEANT4 enable accurate prediction of the spatial and energy resolution of monolithic scintillator PET detectors.},

@article{Seifert2012,
abstract = {The timing performance of scintillation detectors is ultimately limited by photon counting statistics. In fact, photon counting statistics form a dominant contribution to the overall timing resolution of many state-of-the-art detectors. A common approach to investigate this contribution is to calculate the variance in the registration times of individual scintillation photons within the photosensor. However, in general the single-photon variance is not equal to the intrinsic limit on the timing resolution, since in principle one can make use of the timing information carried by all photons detected. In this work, the Cram\'{e}r-Rao lower bound on the timing resolution of a scintillation detector, based on the information contained in the full set of registered photons, is calculated. The results appear to be in good agreement with trends observed in the literature. Furthermore, it is shown that the timestamp obtained from any single scintillation photon never yields the optimum timing resolution for realistic scintillation detectors. Yet, it appears that the intrinsic timing resolution limit can be approached closely by making use of the timestamps from a relatively small number of photons emitted during the initial part of the scintillation pulse.},

This is particularly important for those image photo detectors in which complex circuit functions are required and a substantial fraction of the pixel area is consumed, like e.g., 3D camera, SPAD arrays, fluorescence analyzers, etc., but also in CMOS sensors. So far, the low fill-factor was an unacceptable loss of sensitivity precluding from the development of such devices, whereas by using a concentrator array a recovery is possible, up to the inverse square of numerical aperture of the objective lens. By ray tracing, we calculate the concentration factors of several geometries of non-imaging concentrator, i.e., truncated cone, parabolic and compound parabolic, both reflective and refractive. The feasibility of a sizeable recovery of fill-factor (up to 50) is demonstrated.},

abstract = {Cram\'{e}r-Rao theory can be used to derive the lower bound on the spatial resolution achievable with position-sensitive scintillation detectors as a function of the detector geometry and the pertinent physical properties of the scintillator, the photosensor and the readout electronics. Knowledge of the Cram\'{e}r-Rao lower bound (CRLB) can for example be used to optimize the detector design and to test the performance of the method used to derive position information from the detector signals. Here, this approach is demonstrated for monolithic scintillator detectors for positron emission tomography. Two detector geometries are investigated: a 20 × 10 × 10 mm(3) and a 20 × 10 × 20 mm(3) monolithic LYSO:Ce(3+) crystal read out by one or two Hamamatsu S8550SPL avalanche photodiode (APD) arrays, respectively. The results indicate that in these detectors the CRLB is primarily determined by the APD excess noise factor and the number of scintillation photons detected. Furthermore, it is shown that the use of a k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) algorithm for position estimation allows the experimentally obtained spatial resolution to closely approach the CRLB. The approach outlined in this work can in principle be applied to any scintillation detector in which position information is encoded in the distribution of the scintillation light over multiple photosensor elements.},

abstract = {Annihilation photon acollinearity is a fundamental but little investigated problem in positron emission tomography (PET). In this paper, the cause of the angular deviation from 180.00 degrees is described as well as how to evaluate it under conditions of a spatially distributed radiation source and a limited acquisition time for the human body. A relationship between the shape of the photopeak spectrum and the angular distribution is formulated using conservation laws of momentum and energy over the pair annihilation. Then the formula is used to evaluate the acollinearity for a pool phantom and the human body with FDG injected. The angular distribution for the pool phantom agrees well with that for pure water which had been directly measured by Colombino et al in 1965 (Nuovo Cimento 38 707-23), and also with that for the human body determined in this study. Pure water can be considered as a good approximation of the human body regarding the angular deviation. The blurring coefficient to be multiplied by the ring diameter in calculations of the PET spatial resolution is experimentally determined for the first time as 0.00243 +/- 0.00014; this is 10\% larger than the value widely used by investigators.},

@article{Choong2009,
abstract = {Recent advancements in fast scintillating materials and fast photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) have stimulated renewed interest in time-of-flight (TOF) positron emission tomography (PET). It is well known that the improvement in the timing resolution in PET can significantly reduce the noise variance in the reconstructed image resulting in improved image quality. In order to evaluate the timing performance of scintillation detectors used in TOF PET, we use Monte Carlo analysis to model the physical processes (crystal geometry, crystal surface finish, scintillator rise time, scintillator decay time, photoelectron yield, PMT transit time spread, PMT single-electron response, amplifier response and time pick-off method) that can contribute to the timing resolution of scintillation-detector systems. In the Monte Carlo analysis, the photoelectron emissions are modeled by a rate function, which is used to generate the photoelectron time points. The rate function, which is simulated using Geant4, represents the combined intrinsic light emissions of the scintillator and the subsequent light transport through the crystal. The PMT output signal is determined by the superposition of the PMT single-electron response resulting from the photoelectron emissions. The transit time spread and the single-electron gain variation of the PMT are modeled in the analysis. Three practical time pick-off methods are considered in the analysis. Statistically, the best timing resolution is achieved with the first photoelectron timing. The calculated timing resolution suggests that a leading edge discriminator gives better timing performance than a constant fraction discriminator and produces comparable results when a two-threshold or three-threshold discriminator is used. For a typical PMT, the effect of detector noise on the timing resolution is negligible. The calculated timing resolution is found to improve with increasing mean photoelectron yield, decreasing scintillator decay time and decreasing transit time spread. However, only substantial improvement in the timing resolution is obtained with improved transit time spread if the first photoelectron timing is less than the transit time spread. While the calculated timing performance does not seem to be affected by the pixel size of the crystal, it improves for an etched crystal compared to a polished crystal. In addition, the calculated timing resolution degrades with increasing crystal length. These observations can be explained by studying the initial photoelectron rate. Experimental measurements provide reasonably good agreement with the calculated timing resolution. The Monte Carlo analysis developed in this work will allow us to optimize the scintillation detectors for timing and to understand the physical factors limiting their performance.},

@article{Schaart2010,
abstract = {The use of time-of-flight (TOF) information in positron emission tomography (PET) enables significant improvement in image noise properties and, therefore, lesion detection. Silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) are solid-state photosensors that have several advantages over photomultiplier tubes (PMTs). SiPMs are small, essentially transparent to 511 keV gamma rays and insensitive to magnetic fields. This enables novel detector designs aimed at e.g. compactness, high resolution, depth-of-interaction (DOI) correction and MRI compatibility. The goal of the present work is to study the timing performance of SiPMs in combination with LaBr(3):Ce(5\%), a relatively new scintillator with promising characteristics for TOF-PET. Measurements were performed with two, bare, 3 mm x 3 mm x 5 mm LaBr(3):Ce(5\%) crystals, each coupled to a 3 mm x 3 mm SiPM. Using a (22)Na point source placed at various positions in between the two detectors, a coincidence resolving time (CRT) of approximately 100 ps FWHM for 511 keV annihilation photon pairs was achieved, corresponding to a TOF positioning resolution of approximately 15 mm FWHM. At the same time, pulse height spectra with well-resolved full-energy peaks were obtained. To our knowledge this is the best CRT reported for SiPM-based scintillation detectors to date. It is concluded that SiPM-based scintillation detectors can provide timing resolutions at least as good as detectors based on PMTs.},

@article{Yang2013,
abstract = {Scintillation crystal design is a critical component in positron emission tomography system development, which impacts a number of performance parameters including energy resolution, time resolution and spatial resolution. Our work aims to develop a generalized simulation tool to model the light transport inside scintillation crystals with good accuracy, taking into account surface treatments, reflectors, temporal dependence of scintillation decay, and comprehensive experimental validations. The simulation has been validated against both direct analytical calculation and experimental measurements. In this work, the studies were performed for a lutetium-yttrium oxyorthosilicate crystal of 3×3×20 mm3 dimension coupled to a Hamamatsu silicon photomultiplier, with respect to light output, rise-time slope, energy resolution and time resolution. Four crystal surface treatment and reflector configurations were investigated: GroundMetal, GroundPaint, PolishMetal and PolishPaint. The experiments were performed to validate the Monte Carlo simulation results. The results indicate that the best time resolution (0.96±0.05 ns) and good energy resolution (10.6±0.4\%) could be produced by using a polished surface with specular reflector, while the configuration of a polished surface with diffusive reflector produces the best energy resolution (10.2±0.9\%). The results indicate that a polished surface with diffusive reflector achieves the best energy resolution (10.2±0.9\%) for 511 keV high energy photons, and a polished surface with specular reflector achieves the best time resolution (0.96±0.05 ns) measured against a Hamamatsu fast photomultiplier tube. The ground surface treatment is not recommended for its inferior performance in terms of energy and time resolution. Possible explanations and future improvements to be made to the developed simulation tool are discussed.},

The factors influencing the time resolution of a TOF PET scanner are presented, with focus on the intrinsic properties of scintillators of particular interest for TOF PET. Finally, some open issues, challenges and achievements of today's TOF PET reconstruction are reviewed: the structure of the data organization, the choice of analytical or iterative method, the recent experimental assessment of TOF image quality, and the most promising applications of TOF PET.},

abstract = {Silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) are of great interest to positron emission tomography (PET), as they enable new detector geometries, for e.g., depth-of-interaction (DOI) determination, are MR compatible, and offer faster response and higher gain than other solid-state photosensors such as avalanche photodiodes. Here we present a novel detector design with DOI correction, in which a position-sensitive SiPM array is used to read out a monolithic scintillator. Initial characterization of a prototype detector consisting of a 4 x 4 SiPM array coupled to either the front or back surface of a 13.2 mm x 13.2 mm x 10 mm LYSO:Ce(3+) crystal shows that front-side readout results in significantly better performance than conventional back-side readout. Spatial resolutions <1.6 mm full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) were measured at the detector centre in response to an approximately 0.54 mm FWHM diameter test beam. Hardly any resolution losses were observed at angles of incidence up to 45 degrees , demonstrating excellent DOI correction. About 14\% FWHM energy resolution was obtained. The timing resolution, measured in coincidence with a BaF(2) detector, equals 960 ps FWHM.},

abstract = {Establishing the fundamental limit of nanophotonic light-trapping schemes is of paramount importance and is becoming increasingly urgent for current solar cell research. The standard theory of light trapping demonstrated that absorption enhancement in a medium cannot exceed a factor of 4n(2)/sin(2)$\theta$, where n is the refractive index of the active layer, and $\theta$ is the angle of the emission cone in the medium surrounding the cell. This theory, however, is not applicable in the nanophotonic regime. Here we develop a statistical temporal coupled-mode theory of light trapping based on a rigorous electromagnetic approach. Our theory reveals that the conventional limit can be substantially surpassed when optical modes exhibit deep-subwavelength-scale field confinement, opening new avenues for highly efficient next-generation solar cells.},

@article{Shao2007,
abstract = {The coincidence timing resolution is a critical parameter which to a large extent determines the system performance of positron emission tomography (PET). This is particularly true for time-of-flight (TOF) PET that requires an excellent coincidence timing resolution (<<1 ns) in order to significantly improve the image quality. The intrinsic timing resolution is conventionally calculated with a single-exponential timing model that includes two parameters of a scintillator detector: scintillation decay time and total photoelectron yield from the photon-electron conversion. However, this calculation has led to significant errors when the coincidence timing resolution reaches 1 ns or less. In this paper, a bi-exponential timing model is derived and evaluated. The new timing model includes an additional parameter of a scintillator detector: scintillation rise time. The effect of rise time on the timing resolution has been investigated analytically, and the results reveal that the rise time can significantly change the timing resolution of fast scintillators that have short decay time constants. Compared with measured data, the calculations have shown that the new timing model significantly improves the accuracy in the calculation of timing resolutions.},

abstract = {Nanoplasmonics is the emerging research field that studies light-matter interactions mediated by resonant excitations of surface plasmons in metallic nanostructures. It allows the manipulation of the flow of light and its interaction with matter at the nanoscale (10(-9) m). One of the most promising characteristics of plasmonic resonances is that they occur at frequencies corresponding to typical electronic excitations in matter. This leads to the appearance of strong interactions between localized surface plasmons and light emitters (such as molecules, dyes, or quantum dots) placed in the vicinity of metals. Recent advances in nanofabrication and the development of novel concepts in theoretical nanophotonics have opened the way to the design of structures aimed to reduce the lifetime and enhance the decay rate and quantum efficiency of available emitters. In this article, some of the most relevant experimental and theoretical achievements accomplished over the last several years are presented and analyzed.},

@article{Kwon2011,
abstract = {Silicon photomultiplier (SiPM; also called a Geiger-mode avalanche photodiode) is a promising semiconductor photosensor in PET and PET/MRI because it is intrinsically MRI-compatible and has internal gain and timing properties comparable to those of a photomultiplier tube. In this study, we have developed a small-animal PET system using SiPMs and lutetium gadolinium oxyorthosilicate (LGSO) crystals and performed physical evaluation and animal imaging studies to show the feasibility of this system. METHODS: The SiPM PET system consists of 8 detectors, each of which comprises 2 × 6 SiPMs and 4 × 13 LGSO crystals. Each crystal has dimensions of 1.5 × 1.5 × 7 mm. The crystal face-to-face diameter and axial field of view are 6.0 cm and 6.5 mm, respectively. Bias voltage is applied to each SiPM using a finely controlled voltage supply because the gain of the SiPM strongly depends on the supply voltage. The physical characteristics were studied by measuring energy resolution, sensitivity, and spatial resolution. Various mouse and rat images were obtained to study the feasibility of the SiPM PET system in in vivo animal studies. Reconstructed PET images using a maximum-likelihood expectation maximization algorithm were coregistered with animal CT images. Results: All individual LGSO crystals within the detectors were clearly distinguishable in flood images obtained by irradiating the detector using a (22)Na point source. The energy resolution for individual crystals was 25.8\% ± 2.6\% on average for 511-keV photopeaks. The spatial resolution measured with the (22)Na point source in a warm background was 1.0 mm (2 mm off-center) and 1.4 mm (16 mm off-center) when the maximum-likelihood expectation maximization algorithm was applied. A myocardial (18)F-FDG study in mice and a skeletal (18)F study in rats demonstrated the fine spatial resolution of the scanner. The feasibility of the SiPM PET system was also confirmed in the tumor images of mice using (18)F-FDG and (68)Ga-RGD and in the brain images of rats using (18)F-FDG. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that it is possible to develop a PET system using a promising semiconductor photosensor, which yielded reasonable PET performance in phantom and animal studies.},

@article{Constantin2010,
abstract = {Most of the treatment head components of medical linear accelerators used in radiation therapy have complex geometrical shapes. They are typically designed using computer-aided design (CAD) applications. In Monte Carlo simulations of radiotherapy beam transport through the treatment head components, the relevant beam-generating and beam-modifying devices are inserted in the simulation toolkit using geometrical approximations of these components. Depending on their complexity, such approximations may introduce errors that can be propagated throughout the simulation. This drawback can be minimized by exporting a more precise geometry of the linac components from CAD and importing it into the Monte Carlo simulation environment. We present a technique that links three-dimensional CAD drawings of the treatment head components to Geant4 Monte Carlo simulations of dose deposition.},
