In this paper the degradation in the time resolution of scintillator detectors due to light transport is discussed. Theoretical results using the Cram\'{e}r-Rao lower bound, combined with simulation of light transport within the scintillator crystal are presented. We show that a non-negligible degradation will occur when lateral facets of a scintillator crystal are wrapped using a Lambertian material.
